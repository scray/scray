# Commercial Paper Tutorial

This folder contains the code for an introductory tutorial to Smart Contract development. It is based around the scenario of Commercial Paper.
The full tutorial, including full scenario details and line by line code walk-through is in the [Hyperledger Fabric Commercial Paper Tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/commercial_paper.html).

## Scenario

In this tutorial two organizations, MagnetoCorp and DigiBank, trade commercial paper with each other using 'PaperNet', a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.

Once you’ve set up a basic network, you’ll act as Isabella, an employee of MagnetoCorp, who will issue a commercial paper on its behalf. You’ll then switch hats to take the role of Balaji, an employee of DigiBank, who will buy this commercial paper, hold it for a period of time, and then redeem it with MagnetoCorp for a small profit.

## Quick Start

You are strongly advised to read the full tutorial to get information about the code and the scenario. Below are the quick start instructions for running the tutorial, but without extensive details of what is happening.

This `README.md` file is in the `commercial-paper` directory, the source code for client applications and the contracts is in the `organization` directory.

### Steps

1) Start the Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure

  The 'test-network' will be used - this has two organizations 'org1' and 'org2'  DigiBank will be org1, and MagnetoCorp will be org2. 

2) Install and Instantiate the Contracts

3) Run client applications in the roles of MagnetoCorp and DigiBank to trade the commercial paper

   - Issue the Paper as Magnetocorp (org2)
   - Buy the paper as DigiBank (org1)
   - Redeem the paper as DigiBank (org1)

## Setup

You will need a machine with the following

- Docker and docker-compose installed
- Node.js v12 if you want to run JavaScript client applications
- Java v8 if you want to run Java client applications
- Maven to build the Java applications

You will need to install the peer cli binaries and this fabric-samples repository available. For more information
[Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

It is advised to have 3 console windows open; one to monitor the infrastructure and one each for MagnetoCorp and DigiBank. Once you've cloned the fabric-samples - change to the commercial-paper directory in each window. 

```
cd fabric-samples/commercial-paper
```

## Running the Infrastructure

In one console window, run the `./network-starter.sh` script; this will start the basic infrastructure.

You can re-use this console window if you wish, but it is recommended to run a docker container monitoring script. This will let you view what Fabric is doing and help diagnose any failures.

```bash
./organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/monitordocker.sh net_test
```

### Setup the Organizations' environments

The contract code is available as either JavaScript, Java or Go. You can use either one, and the choice of contract language does not affect the choice of client language. With the v2.0 Fabric chaincode lifecycle, this requires operations for both MagentoCorp and Digibank admin.  Open two windows in the fabric-samples/commercial paper directory, one for each organization.

In your 'MagnetoCorp' window run the following commands, to show the shell environment variables needed to act as that organization.

```
cd fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp
./magnetocorp.sh
```

You can either copy and paste thee directly into the terminal, or invoke directly in you own command shell. For example if you are using bash or zsh on Linux you can use this command.

```
source <(./magnetocorp.sh)
```

Similarly in your 'DigiBank' window run the following command

```
cd fabric-samples/commercial-paper/digibank
./digibank.sh
```

### Deploy the smart contract to the channel

You need to perform similar operations for both organizations. For different contract langauges the steps are very similar. The steps for JavaScript are shown first, with the details of different languages afterwards. 


**For a JavaScript Contract**

Running in MagnetoCorp:

```
# MAGENTOCORP

peer lifecycle chaincode package cp.tar.gz --lang node --path ./contract --label cp_0
peer lifecycle chaincode install cp.tar.gz

export PACKAGE_ID=$(peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled --output json | jq -r '.installed_chaincodes[0].package_id')
echo $PACKAGE_ID

peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg  --orderer localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com \
                                          --channelID mychannel  \
                                          --name papercontract  \
                                          -v 0  \
                                          --package-id $PACKAGE_ID \
                                          --sequence 1  \
                                          --tls  \
                                          --cafile $ORDERER_CA
                                          
peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness --channelID mychannel --name papercontract -v 0 --sequence 1
```

Running in Digibank

```

# DIGIBANK

peer lifecycle chaincode package cp.tar.gz --lang node --path ./contract --label cp_0
peer lifecycle chaincode install cp.tar.gz

export PACKAGE_ID=$(peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled --output json | jq -r '.installed_chaincodes[0].package_id')
echo $PACKAGE_ID

peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg  --orderer localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com \
                                          --channelID mychannel  \
                                          --name papercontract  \
                                          -v 0  \
                                          --package-id $PACKAGE_ID \
                                          --sequence 1  \
                                          --tls  \
                                          --cafile $ORDERER_CA

peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness --channelID mychannel --name papercontract -v 0 --sequence 1

```

Once both organizations have installed, and approved the chaincode, it can be committed.

```
# MAGNETOCORP

peer lifecycle chaincode commit -o localhost:7050 \
                                --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PEER0_ORG1_CA} \
                                --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PEER0_ORG2_CA} \
                                --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com \
                                --channelID mychannel --name papercontract -v 0 \
                                --sequence 1 \
                                --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --waitForEvent 

```

To test try sending some simple transactions.

```

peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050  --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com \
                                --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PEER0_ORG1_CA} \
                                --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PEER0_ORG2_CA} \
                                --channelID mychannel --name papercontract \
                                -c '{"Args":["org.papernet.commercialpaper:instantiate"]}' ${PEER_ADDRESS_ORG1} ${PEER_ADDRESS_ORG2} \
                                --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA --waitForEvent

peer chaincode query -o localhost:7050  --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com \
                                        --channelID mychannel \
                                        --name papercontract \
                                        -c '{"Args":["org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata"]}' \
                                        --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles ${PEER0_ORG2_CA} \
                                        --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA | jq -C | more
```

**For a Java Contract:**

Before the `peer lifecycle chaincode package` command, you will need to change into each organization's `contract-java` directory and issues

```
./gradlew build
```

Then when you package the contract, use this variation of the command to specify language
```
peer lifecycle chaincode package cp.tar.gz --lang java --path /opt/gopath/src/github.com/contract-java --label cp_0
```

After this point the steps are exactly the same as for JavaScript

**For a Go Contract:**


Before the `peer lifecycle chaincode package` command, you will need to change into each organization's `contract-go` directory and issues

```
go mod vendor
```

Then when you package the contract, use this variation of the command to specify language
```
peer lifecycle chaincode package cp.tar.gz --lang golang --path ./contract-go --label cp_0
```

After this point the steps are exactly the same as for JavaScript


## Client Applications

Note for Java applications you will need to compile the Java Code using maven. Use this command in each application-java directory

```
mvn clean package
```

Note for JavaScript applications you will need to install the dependencies first. Use this command in each application directory

```
npm install
```
>  Note that there is NO dependency between the language of any one client application and any contract. Mix and match as you wish!

The docker containers don't contain the node or Java runtimes; so it is best to exit the docker containers - but keep the windows open and run the applications locally.

### Issue the paper

This is running as *MagnetoCorp* These commands are to be run in the
`commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application` directory or the `commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application-java`

*Add the Identity to be used*

```
node addToWallet.js
# or
java -cp target/commercial-paper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar org.magnetocorp.AddToWallet
```

*Issue the Commercial Paper*

```
node issue.js
# or
java -cp target/commercial-paper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar org.magnetocorp.Issue
```

### Buy and Redeem the paper

This is running as *Digibank*; 

You can now run the applications to buy and redeem the paper. Change to either the
`commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application` directory or  `commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application-java`

*Add the Identity to be used*

```
node addToWallet.js
# or
java -cp target/commercial-paper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar org.digibank.AddToWallet
```

*Buy the paper*

```
node buy.js
# or
java -cp target/commercial-paper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar org.digibank.Buy
```

*Redeem*

```
node redeem.js
# or
java -cp target/commercial-paper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar org.digibank.Redeem
```

## Clean up
When you are finished using the Fabric test network and the commercial paper smart contract and applications, you can use the following command to clean up the network:

```
./network-clean.sh 
```
